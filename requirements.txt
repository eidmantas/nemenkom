# Single dependency set used by all production containers.
#
# Dev/test tooling stays in `requirements-dev.txt`.
#
# Notes:
# - We want the latest OpenAI SDK (`openai>=2`). Some third-party tools (e.g. `marker-pdf`)
#   still pin `openai<2`; those must be installed in a separate step (see `Dockerfile.scraper-pdf`)
#   and then we force-upgrade `openai` afterwards.
